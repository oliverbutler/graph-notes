# What is Slate? 🚀

Slate intends to take advantages from other such platforms such as Notion and Obsidian and combine them into an extendable, secure, offline-first, rich environment. Most importantly, open-source ❤️.

> We pledge that Slate's source-code will always remain public, and that we won't hide away features behind a paywall, any services that we do create with a payment, could easily be hosted yourself!

## Our Values

### 🥇 Privacy

- You will never hear stories about Slate contributors reading through your personal data.
- Unless you want it to, no data ever leaves your machine.

### ❤️ Free and Community Driven

- Slate was created by the community, for the community.

### 🌍✂️💻 Offline First

- As an electron application we store all data locally
- Don't worry about us having issues, being DDoSd or deleting your data
- If you want to move your files elsewhere, be our guest.
- Want an extra backup? Just copy your files and move them elsewhere.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast

- No overhead from cloud providers
- Store and read straight from your machine

<!-- # Our Planned Products at Slate

Below are some of the projects we plan to design and produce, all of our provided services will be open-source and self-hostable, if you want nothing to do with the cloud... Host it yourself!

## ❤️ Slate Client [🚧 WIP]

- Electron Based application to write and manage Slate notes
- Share files locally to friends, family, and co-workers on the same network

## 📡 Slate Relay [💡 Idea]

- Select a file, click share, and we'll host it for you for people to see
- Publish an API of your chosen content, much like a CMS.

## 🌐 Slate Backup [💡 Idea]

- Slate Client would encrypt your files on your machine
- Send them to a secure backup server
- Backups are ready for when you need them -->

# Alternative Products

At Slate we have identified two of the most powerful note taking platforms, these being Notion and Obsidian. These two platforms give many users two choices: being locked into a cloud based rich text, feature-rich environment. Or being offline and secure, but with the natural limitations of Markdown.

## Notion

Notion is a fantastic tool, it's interface is industry-defining and has caught the organizational people amongst us off-guard.

- ✅ Blocks of rich text data
- ✅ 'Database' Support
- ✅ Team oriented design
- ❌ Closed-source 💔
- ❌ Cloud based - no offline support
- ❌ No _true_ data ownership, Employees **can** read your documents 🕵️‍♂️

## Obsidian

Obsidian is a second 🧠 - a platform to work with existing folder structures and files in it's own productive way.

- ✅ Offline-first design
- ✅ Links as first class citizens
- ✅ Fantastic MD editing features
- ✅ Graph View
- 🤷‍♀️ Markdown (Very personal, don't want to step on toes)
- ❌ Closed-source 💔
- ❌ Cloud publishing features aren't self-hostable
- ❌ No rich text features or WYSIWYG editor

## Contributions

We are always open to contributions and PR, however as we are currently in early alpha there is no licence or Contribution guidance.

## Contact

For all enquiries please contact dev@oliverbutler.uk, help@slate.sh will be available soon.
