## Contributions

We are always open to contributions and PR, however as we are currently in early alpha there is no licence or Contribution guidance.

## Contact

For all enquiries please contact dev@oliverbutler.uk, help@xeo.sh will be available soon.

## Project Scope

Originally we were focussing on an Electron, offline-only application, however, it seems the community as a whole is looking for a self-hostable solution with a web app as the first priority.
