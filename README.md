# What is Xeo? 🚀

Xeo (_zee-oh_) is an offline-first Notion, Obsidian, and Trello alternative with a key focus on productivity, security, and privacy. Xeo consists of individual components rather than one cloud based platform so you can customize it to your specific needs.

Xeo turns the standard client-server model on it's head and allows you, from your Xeo Electron client, to optionally connect to different services, such as our cloud server, or your own self-hosted server, to allow for: sharing, syncing, and backing up of your notes and data.

## Features

- 📝 Notion-like Rich Text Editor
- 🌍 Fully Offline Desktop Client
- 🔌 Plug and Play Server Integration
- 🏡 Self-Hostable and Private
- 🚧 WIP Database Features

## 🌍 Offline First

When you're offline, your 🧠 doesn't stop - why should your note taking? Rather than having a reliance upon a central server for all of your notes we make the server optional.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Currently this is a WIP, either build the develop branch or hang on a bit longer for V0.1.

## 📡 Optional Server [wip 🚧]

- Backup and Sync notes between clients
- Self-Hostable or subscribe as a SaaS
- Share notes
- Public API for your documents and data

## Contributions

We are always open to contributions and PR, however as we are currently in early alpha there is no licence or Contribution guidance.

## Contact

For all enquiries please contact dev@oliverbutler.uk, help@xeo.sh will be available soon.
